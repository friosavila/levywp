  abstract   = {In the era of data revolution, availability and presence of data is a huge wealth that has to be utilized. Instead of making new surveys, benefit can be made from data that already exists. As enormous amounts of data become available, it is becoming essential to undertake research that involves integrating data from multiple sources in order to make the best use out of it. Statistical Data Integration (SDI) is the statistical tool for considering this issue. SDI can be used to integrate data files that have common units, and it also allows to merge unrelated files that do not share any common units, depending on the input data. The convenient method of data integration is determined according to the nature of the input data. SDI has two main methods, Record Linkage (RL) and Statistical Matching (SM). SM techniques typically aim to achieve a complete data file from different sources which do not contain the same units. This paper aims at giving a complete overview of existing SM methods, both classical and recent, in order to provide a unified summary of various SM techniques along with their drawbacks. Points for future research are suggested at the end of this paper.},

In addition to the many of the variables included in census data (race and ethnicity, education, income, occupation, industry, migration, disability, and veteran status), IPUMS-CPS includes additional information on work and income, such as participation in welfare programs, job searching, barriers to looking for work, union membership, hourly wages, health insurance, and tax liability. In addition, monthly supplements supplemental for certain years include information on computer and Internet use, displaced workers, fertility, food security, job tenure, tobacco use, volunteer activities, voter registration, and work schedules. IPUMS-CPS data are available through an online data access system free of charge to registered users at cps.ipums.org.},

The second match combines the 1985 American Use of Time Project survey (AUTP) with the 1993 ADS. The third match combines the 2007 SCF with the 2008 March Supplement to the CPS, now called the Annual Social and Economics Supplement (ASEC). The fourth match combines the 2007 American Time Use Survey with the 2008 ASEC. In each case, the alignment of the two datasets is examined, after which various aspects of the match quality are described.

  abstract   = {Data fusion techniques typically aim to achieve a complete data file from different sources which do not contain the same units. Traditionally, data fusion, in the US also addressed by the term statistical matching, is done on the basis of variables common to all files. It is well known that those approaches establish conditional independence of the (specific) variables not jointly observed given the common variables, although they may be conditionally dependent in reality. However, if the common variables are (carefully) chosen in a way that already establishes conditional independence, then inference about the actually unobserved association is valid. In terms of regression analysis, this implies that the explanatory power of the common variables is high concerning the specific variables. Unfortunately, this assumption is not testable yet. Hence, we structure and discuss the objectives of statistical matching in the light of their feasibility. Four levels of validitya matching technique may achieve are introduced. By means of suitable multiple imputation (MI) techniques, the identification problem which is inherent in data fusion is reflected. In a simulation study it is also shown that MI allows to efficiently and easily use auxiliary information.},
